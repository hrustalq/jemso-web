## 💡 Pro Tip

URL should look like:
```
https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/[ID]/[ID]-hd_1280_720_30fps.mp4
```

If it doesn't end in `.mp4`, it won't work!

---

## ❓ Not Working?

Check:
- [ ] URL ends with `.mp4`
- [ ] You're on desktop (videos don't play on mobile)
- [ ] You're hovering over the card
- [ ] Browser console for errors (F12)

**That's it! Your category cards now have awesome videos! 🎉**
